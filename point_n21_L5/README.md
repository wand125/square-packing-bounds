# Point-only endpoint certificate for s(21) = 5

**Computer-assisted certificate with a complete rational replay. Both the split
replay and a fresh one-command M1 run have passed all numerical stages and exact
assembly. The same certificate is also proved in Lean 4 with no hypothesis:
`minSide 21 = 5` is kernel-checked from Evan Daniel's zero-margin box tree,
using only the standard axioms (see [lean/zero-margin/](lean/zero-margin/README.md)).
Independent external review is not claimed.**

This certificate uses 4,604 nonnegative point weights in the side-5 container.
Its all-pose capture threshold is `q = 249987/250000`, and its total mass is
`2624862500021/125000000000`. Thus

```
21q - mass = 999979/125000000000 > 0.
```

The proof excludes packings in every smaller container. It allows boundary
contact: enlarge a hypothetical packing from side `L < 5` to side 5, then take
the concentric closed unit squares strictly inside the enlarged squares. They
are pairwise disjoint, so their captured point masses cannot sum to more than
the total measure. This contradicts the displayed strict gap. The 5-by-5 unit
grid supplies the matching upper bound. The same grid and monotonicity give
`s(n)=5` for `22 <= n <= 25` as corollaries.

Evan Daniel already published a mixed point-and-segment proof of `s(21)=5`.
This work does not claim priority for that value. Our supports are derived from
his earlier point certificate and the weights were re-optimised. Attribution,
exact provenance, and his retained licence accompany the distribution.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.12 or later. Run these commands from this directory:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-tested.txt
python inspect_certificate.py
python unpack_bundle.py
python verify_portable.py --workers 2 --out /tmp/n21-proof-replay
```

The output directory must not already exist. The lightweight inspection checks
only data identities and rational algebra. The full runner must execute all
numerical stages successfully and finish with `FRESH_ALL_DOMAIN_REPLAY_VERIFIED`.
It checks 5,000 roots, 8,758 sieve parents, and all 31,678 required frontier
parents; 7,052 further parents lie strictly outside the representative angle
domain. Reducing `--workers` changes scheduling, not mathematical coverage.
Do not use Python's `-O` option.

This is a separate rational verification route. The repository's older
`src/verify.py` and its rectangle checkers do not verify this endpoint bundle.
Successful execution is a computer-assisted check, not a proof-assistant proof
or an external review.

## Lean reduction

[lean/](lean/README.md) proves `minSide 21 = 5` in Lean 4 from the single
hypothesis that the checker-domain capture bound holds (the statement the
rational replay above establishes). The point data, total mass, D4 invariance,
normalisation, angle sufficiency, scaling argument and grid packing are proved
in Lean, using only the standard axioms. It builds as an overlay on Evan
Daniel's unmodified Lean project at the pinned upstream commit:
`sh lean/build_lean.sh <new directory>`.

The package includes `PUBLICATION.md`, `PROOF-LEMMAS.md`, `FORMAT.md`, the original
and normalised point data, and `archive-index.json`. The 14 archive parts total
455,327,325 bytes; unpacked inputs occupy about 2.54 GB. Allow additional space
for temporary extraction and replay outputs. `unpack_bundle.py` requires a new
`bundle/` directory, verifies every archive part and all 75,130 input files,
and reports `BUNDLE_BYTES_VERIFIED`. This reports byte integrity only.

All Python files from the bundle are also readable under `verifier-source/`.
The unpacker checks these copies against the extracted sources. The numerical
runner uses the extracted `bundle/`. Do not edit either copy before replay.

The complete one-command run took 8,577.3 seconds (about 2 hours 23 minutes) on
an M1 with two workers. All four numerical stage processes exited zero, and
exact assembly returned `FRESH_ALL_DOMAIN_REPLAY_VERIFIED`. See
[acceptance/README.md](acceptance/README.md) for the complete records.

That run used the original frozen bundle. Every one of its 75,130 actual input
reads is preserved byte-for-byte in this smaller distribution, and a separate
archive extraction checked every distributed file. We distinguish that
packaging check from numerical replay; a full run starting from these compressed
parts was not separately timed. The commands above reproduce the same numerical
verification from the distributed inputs.

## Notes on frozen sources

The Python sources in the archive are bound by hash: the unpacker checks
`verifier-source/` against the archive manifest, and the checker binds every
source it reads. On 2026-10-04 the archive was rebuilt with two kinds of edit,
neither of which changes any mathematical content:

- 53 JSON records contained absolute paths of the machine they were made on.
  Those paths are now relative to the bundle root (`portable_replay.py` already
  resolves relative paths against the bundle root), and the hashes that other
  records embed for the edited files were updated to match.
- `src/nagamochi_research/mixed_proof_pipeline.py`, which the checking path does
  not use, had status messages in Japanese; they are now in English.

`path-relativization-map.json` lists every edited file with its SHA256 before
and after, and the previous manifest and archive hashes. The recorded numerical
runs in `acceptance/` were made on the previous bytes; their linkage records
were edited the same way (paths only), and their hash fields were updated as
listed in the map.

Two cosmetic points were left as they are:

- `predicate_branch.py` and `predicate_lp_capture.py` import NumPy at module
  level without using it (SciPy is used by both).
- The scripts under `verifier-source/runs/evand_n21_n32_bridge_20260927/results/n21_L5_refit29_*`
  other than `n21_L5_refit29_final_replay/` (`check.py` in `scoped_gate/` and
  `theorem_audit/`, `audit.py` in `binding_scope_review/`, and the unit tests in
  `soundness_review/`) are historical audit scripts. The checking path does not
  import or run them. `check.py` and `audit.py` read original worker output
  folders, `terminals.json`, review binding files and `review.md`, which are not
  distributed, so they cannot be run from this package. The unit tests need only
  `src/nagamochi_research/`.
